% Using some PGF/TikZ features like              %
%      'layer'                                   %
%      'decorate'                                % 
%       and the wonderful new 'spy'-feature      % 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Note: This example requires PGF > 2.0 or a recent
% development version of PGF.
